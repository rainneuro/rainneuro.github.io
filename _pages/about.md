I'm Ruien Wang, currently a graduate student of cognitive neuroscience at Department of Psychology and Queen's Neuroeconomics lab (PI: Prof. Anita Tusche) at Queen's University, Ontario, Canada. Generally, my research interest focus on social cognitive and affective neuroscience, and aim to delineate the social brain in the real world.
