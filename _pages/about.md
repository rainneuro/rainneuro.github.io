Hello! I'm Ruien Wang (王睿恩 in Chinese), currently a graduate student of cognitive neuroscience at the Department of Psychology working with [Prof. Anita Tusche](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/people/anita-tusche) in [Queen's Neuroeconomics Lab](https://anitatusche.com/) at Queen's University, Ontario, Canada.

During my undergraduate study at the University of Macau, I worked with [Prof. Haiyan Wu](https://ccbs.ici.um.edu.mo/prof-haiyan-wu/) in [Affective Neuroscience & Decision-Making lab](https://andlab-um.com/) and did some work on oxytocin & face perception, motivated dishonesty, as well as individual difference of neurophysiological representations of emotional experiences ([5-min intro to this work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u638b7JNFzQ)). These research experiences made me want to dedicate my life to the field of social neuroscience. 

Generally, I'm interested in understanding the **individual differences of social affective behavior in real-world, and the underlying neural & computational mechanism; I'm also interested how these individual differences infleunce well-being**. To achieve these goals, I mainly utilize behavioral experiments, experience sampling, eye-tracking, neuroimaging, and computational modeling.
