Humans are inherently social species, and successfully navigating social environments is critical for our well-being. Growing evidence links basic features of social affective cognition, such as social attention, social inference, and emotion regulation to variance in social functioning and well-being across people. It is essential to understand what, why, and how people differ regarding these social affective behaviors, and what are the real-world impact of these variations. Meanwhile, I'm also interested in how social cognitive-affective processes translate from in-lab contexts to real-world settings. Below are the overviews of the research questions and methods:


Here are the main projects I'm currently working on:

## Ongoing cognition, emotion regulation variability, and well-being ###
`Collaborators:` [Dr. Carmen Morawetz](https://www.affectiveneuro.at/), [Dr. Jonny Smallwood](https://www.thinclab.ca/)

## Large-scale cortical network reconfigurations predict emotion regulation success and real-world negative thoughts

## Ongoing cognition, social cognition, and social functioning

## Understanding mentalizing from an evidence accumulation perspective
