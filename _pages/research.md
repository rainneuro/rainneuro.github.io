Humans are inherently social species, and successfully navigating social environments is critical for our well-being. Growing evidence links basic features of social affective cognition, such as social attention, social inference, and emotion regulation to variance in social functioning and well-being across people. It is essential to understand what, why, and how people differ regarding these social affective behaviors, and what are the real-world impact of these variations. Meanwhile, I'm also interested in how social cognitive-affective processes translate from in-lab contexts to real-world settings. Below are the overviews of the research questions and methods:
